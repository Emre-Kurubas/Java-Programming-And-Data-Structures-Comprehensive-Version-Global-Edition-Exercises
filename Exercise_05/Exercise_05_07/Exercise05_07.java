(Financial application: compute future tuition) Suppose that the tuition for a 
university is $10,000 this year and increases 6% every year. In one year, the 
tuition will be $10,600. Write a program that computes the tuition in ten years 
and the total cost of four yearsâ€™ worth of tuition after the tenth year.
