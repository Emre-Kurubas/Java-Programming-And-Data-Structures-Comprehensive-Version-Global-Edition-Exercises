/*
(Financial application: compute the future investment value) Write a method that 
computes future investment value at a given interest rate for a specified number 
of years. The future investment is determined using the formulaÂ in Programming 
Exercise 2.21.
Use the following method header:
public static double futureInvestmentValue(
double investmentAmount, double monthlyInterestRate,int years)
For example, futureInvestmentValue(10000, 0.05/12, 5) returns 
12833.59.
Write a test program that prompts the user to enter the investment amount (e.g., 
1,000) and the interest rate (e.g., 9%) and prints a table that displays future value 
for the years from 1 to 30,
*/

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

    //Prompt the user to enter the amount invested and annual interest rate
		System.out.print("The amount invested: ");
		double amount = scanner.nextDouble();
		System.out.print("Annual interest rate: ");
		double interestRate = scanner.nextDouble();
		double monthlyInterestRate= interestRate/1200;//Calculate monthly interest rate

    //Print the header of our table with necessary spacing
